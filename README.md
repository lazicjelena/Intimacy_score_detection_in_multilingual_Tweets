# Intimacy-detection-in-multilingual-tweets

This repository includes files and code for our work on the SemEval 2023 workshop. Our team participated in the 9th task, named Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis. The repository includes training and test data, as well as five IPython notebook (ipynb) files, each for a single experiment setup. ðŸ˜Š

Intimacy is a fundamental social aspect of language. This SemEval shared task focuses on predicting the intimacy of tweets in 10 languages. The task is co-organized by the University of Michigan and Snap Inc. ðŸŒŸ

We are very proud to be one of the few teams that succeeded in the task, and our work resulted in a paper published in the ACL Anthology. ðŸŽ‰
